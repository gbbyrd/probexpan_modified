## Setup
To run the models, please first download the
custom dataset from this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fzw2EWmOb9Yn6f7RmlFIGcNIt4qYbn4G/view?usp=share_link

Next, run the following commands to extract and create the dataset in the appropriate file directory structure:

```
mkdir data
unzip wiki-20231021T023000Z-001.zip
mv wiki data/
```

Once you have created the dataset, check out the README.md in the ProbExpan-main directory for instructions on pretraining and evaluation.
